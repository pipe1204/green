# üì¶ Product Management Guide

This guide explains how to add, edit, and remove products from the Green e-commerce platform.

## üìÅ File Structure

Products are managed in a single file:

```
data/products.ts
```

## üîß How to Add a New Product

### Step 1: Open the Products File

Navigate to `data/products.ts` and find the `products` array.

### Step 2: Add Your Product Object

Add a new product object to the array. Here's the complete structure:

```typescript
{
  id: "unique-product-id", // Use kebab-case, no spaces
  name: "Product Name", // Display name
  model: "MODEL-2024", // Model number/code
  type: "motorbike", // Options: "motorbike" | "scooter" | "bicycle" | "other"
  price: 5000000, // Price in COP (Colombian Pesos)
  description: "Detailed product description that will be shown on the product page.",

  // Product features (array of strings)
  features: [
    "Feature 1 description",
    "Feature 2 description",
    "Feature 3 description",
    // Add as many as needed
  ],

  // Available colors
  colors: [
    {
      id: "color-id", // Unique color identifier
      name: "Color Name", // Display name
      hex: "#000000", // Hex color code
      image: "/images/product/color-image.jpg", // Image path
      description: "Color description"
    },
    // Add more colors as needed
  ],

  // Product images
  images: [
    {
      id: "image-id",
      url: "/images/product/main-image.jpg",
      alt: "Alt text for accessibility",
      isHero: true // Set to true for the main image
    },
    {
      id: "detail-1",
      url: "/images/product/detail-1.jpg",
      alt: "Detail image description"
    }
    // Add more images as needed
  ],

  // Technical specifications
  specifications: {
    battery: "48V 20Ah", // Battery specification
    range: "80", // Range in km (number as string)
    chargeTime: "3", // Charging time in hours (number as string)
    warranty: "2 a√±os de garant√≠a completa", // Warranty description
    delivery: "5-7 d√≠as h√°biles", // Delivery time
    environmental: "Cero emisiones de CO2", // Environmental benefit

    // Performance specs (optional)
    performance: {
      maxSpeed: "60 km/h",
      power: "3000W",
      torque: "100 Nm"
    },

    // Dimensions (optional)
    dimensions: {
      weight: "45 kg",
      length: "1.8 m",
      width: "0.7 m",
      height: "1.1 m"
    },

    // Features breakdown (optional)
    features: {
      display: "Pantalla LCD 5 pulgadas",
      connectivity: ["Bluetooth", "WiFi", "App m√≥vil"],
      safety: ["ABS", "Frenos regenerativos", "Luces LED"]
    }
  },

  // Environmental benefits
  environmentalBenefits: [
    "Benefit 1",
    "Benefit 2",
    "Benefit 3"
  ],

  // Availability
  availability: "in-stock", // Options: "in-stock" | "pre-order" | "coming-soon"
  deliveryTime: "5-7 d√≠as h√°biles" // Delivery timeframe
}
```

### Step 3: Add Images

1. Create a folder in `public/images/` with your product name (e.g., `public/images/new-product/`)
2. Add your product images to this folder
3. Update the image paths in your product object

### Step 4: Update Featured Products (Optional)

If you want your new product to appear in the hero carousel:

1. Open `data/products.ts`
2. Find the `featuredProducts` array
3. Add your new product to the array

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Edit an Existing Product

### Step 1: Find the Product

1. Open `data/products.ts`
2. Find the product by its `id` in the `products` array

### Step 2: Update Properties

Modify any properties you want to change:

- **Price**: Update the `price` number
- **Description**: Change the `description` text
- **Features**: Add, remove, or modify items in the `features` array
- **Colors**: Add new colors or modify existing ones
- **Specifications**: Update any technical specs

### Step 3: Save Changes

Save the file and the changes will be reflected immediately on the website.

## üóëÔ∏è How to Remove a Product

### Step 1: Remove from Products Array

1. Open `data/products.ts`
2. Find the product in the `products` array
3. Delete the entire product object (including the comma)

### Step 2: Remove from Featured Products (if applicable)

1. If the product was featured, remove it from the `featuredProducts` array
2. Make sure there's at least one featured product remaining

### Step 3: Remove Images (Optional)

1. Delete the product's image folder from `public/images/`
2. This step is optional but recommended to keep the project clean

## üìù Product Types

The platform supports these product types:

- `"motorbike"` - Electric motorcycles
- `"scooter"` - Electric scooters
- `"bicycle"` - Electric bicycles

### Adding Colors

```typescript

    hex: "#FF5733", // Use hex color codes
    image: "/images/product/color-image.jpg",
    description: "Brief color description",
  },
];
```

### Color Images

- Each color should have its own image showing the product in that color
- Images should be high quality and consistent in style
- Recommended size: 800x600px or similar

## üñºÔ∏è Image Guidelines

### Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
